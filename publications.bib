	abstract = {Vascular ageing ({VA}) involves structural and functional changes in blood vessels that contribute to cardiovascular disease. Several non-invasive pulse wave ({PW}) indices have been proposed to assess the arterial stiffness component of {VA} in the clinic and daily life. This study investigated 19 of these indices, identified in recent review articles on {VA}, by using a database comprising 3,837 virtual healthy subjects aged 25 to 75 years, each with unique {PW} signals simulated under various levels of artificial noise to mimic real measurement errors. For each subject, {VA} indices were calculated from filtered {PW} signals and compared with the precise theoretical value of aortic Young's modulus (E\_Ao). In silico {PW} indices showed age-related changes that align with in vivo population studies. The cardio-ankle vascular index ({CAVI}) and all pulse wave velocity ({PWV}) indices showed strong linear correlations with (Pearson's r\_p{\textgreater}0.95). Carotid distensibility showed a strong negative nonlinear correlation (Spearman's r\_s{\textless}-0.99). {CAVI} and distensibility exhibited greater resilience to noise compared to {PWV} indices. Blood-pressure-related indices and photoplethysmography ({PPG})-based indices showed weaker correlations with (r\_p and r\_s{\textless}0.89, r\_p and r\_s{\textless}0.84, respectively). Overall, blood-pressure-related indices were confounded by more cardiovascular properties (heart rate, stroke volume, duration of systole, large artery diameter, and/or peripheral vascular resistance) compared to other studied indices, and ({PPG})-based indices were most affected by noise. In conclusion, carotid-femoral {PWV}, {CAVI} and carotid distensibility emerged as the superior clinical {VA} indicators, with a strong E\_Ao correlation and noise resilience. {PPG}-based indices showed potential for daily {VA} monitoring under minimised noise disturbances.},
